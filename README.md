# Amazon Product Rating Classifier

This was my final project for CS 74, Machine Learning and Stastical Data Analysis. We were tasked with building classifiers for product ratings, using mostly string based input data. The task was to classify products into reviews with 2 or more stars, 3 or more stars, 4 or more stars, multi-classification, and clustering. This classification task leveraged Sklearn vectorizer and logistic and multiclass classifier functions.
